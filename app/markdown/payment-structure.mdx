# Golden Retreat Lombok Villas: Comprehensive Payment Structure

Acquiring a luxury villa at Golden Retreat Lombok Villas is a milestone decision. To ensure a seamless experience, we have established a transparent and phased payment structure.

Payment is divided into distinct stages, each tied to significant construction milestones. This phased approach allows buyers to maintain financial flexibility while ensuring consistent progress and the timely delivery of your villa.

## Stage 1

### Booking Fee and Initial Payment (20%)

This initial stage involves a 5% booking fee, and an additional 15% payment upon signing the purchase agreement to initiate construction.
