2. **Annual Rental Income**  
   Assuming the villa is rented for **26 weeks per year** (50% occupancy), the calculation is as follows:  
   **USD 200 x 7 nights = USD 1,400 per week**  
   **USD 1,400 x 26 weeks = USD 36,400 annually**

3. **Management Fees**  
   With a monthly management fee of **USD 130**, the annual management cost is:

   After deducting **12% in taxes** and the **management fees**, the net annual income is:

   - Taxes: **USD 36,400 x 12% = USD 4,368**
   - Total deductions: **USD 4,368 (taxes) + USD 1,560 (management fees) = USD 5,928**
   - Net revenue: **USD 36,400 - USD 5,928 = USD 30,472**

5. **Return on Investment (ROI)**  
   Based on an investment of **USD 180,000** (leasehold purchase price), the net return is:
